# bhoptimer-SaveGame
Allow the use of !savegame and !loadgame to save progress between map changes and server restarts

Very early version, limited to admin commands currently. functionality is confirmed, but there are likely some bugs that need testing to find.
Also the replay cache doesn't appear to load properly between map changes, likely due to issues around line 443. the file gets deleted properly though.
